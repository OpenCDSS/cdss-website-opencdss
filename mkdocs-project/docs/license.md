# OpenCDSS / License #

Software development funded by the State of Colorado has traditionally not been managed as open source.
Software is often developed by consultants in order to "get the work done".
CDSS software tools have specific purposes and will generally not be sold as a mass-market software.
Consequently, a simple disclaimer has been attached to software.
This approach is inadequate because it does not clearly spell out the terms of use for software code.

The OpenCDSS project is implementing open source projects for each CDSS software product,
including assigning open source licenses to each product.
The license selection is based on a number of criteria, including:

1. Ensure that the software remains open source to the spirit of the open source ethic.
2. Avoid situation where the State (and taxpayers) pay for software development and are later prevented from
using the software or accessing code that was paid for.
3. Encourage collaboration and use by a wide array of entities.
4. Considers license compatibility, for example cases where component licenses may place
constraints on CDSS software licenses.

Appropriate open source licenses are currently being evaluated given the above criteria
and the software component inventory for each product.
When the determination is made, the code repository will be made public and the license
will be attached to software according to the requirements of the license.
All software developers and users will be expected to adhere to the license agreement.
